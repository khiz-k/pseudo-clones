Firebase Amazon (auth, add/remove cart, payment processing, order history, awesome template for any ecommerce builds): https://clone-f1c46.web.app/ -> use test@test.com, password = test123

AWS Amazon (bookstore variation with full CRUD operations, trying aws amplify): http://bookstore-20200921170525-hostingbucket-prod.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/

MERN Amazon (testing search filter, rating, sorting): http://khiz-amazon.herokuapp.com/ I plan to merge this one with the firebase one to make the ultimate build
