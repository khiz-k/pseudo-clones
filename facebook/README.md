The messenger apps mimic all features of Facebook messenger and the website mimics the main posting feature of Facebook, as well as carries an identical UI.

Messenger: Check if server is up @ https://khiz-chat-server.herokuapp.com, if it is then go to https://khiz-chat.netlify.app/ to test the app - no mobile b/c it seems to crash the backend server due to a conflict with heroku hosting. Contact me if there's an issue.
