# Pseudo Clones (1-2 Day Builds Each)
## Will continue to update them in my free time to work towards completion
### My clones for some of the biggest companies in the world.  Featuring Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and more...
#### Hosted and facilatated by netlify, heroku, firebase, mongodb, aws and SQL/NoSQL.
#### Written in React (some w/Typescript), Redux, Node, Express, NoSQL, HTML, SCSS, Java/Spring

Some live examples:

Netflix: https://netflix-clone-5930d.web.app/

Facebook: https://fb-clone-5930d.web.app/

Spotify (not mobile friendly yet): https://khiz-spotify.netlify.app

AirBnb (frontend only): https://airbnb-clone-d6fe5.web.app/

Messenger (v2, unique styling): https://khiz-chat.netlify.app/ - please don't use it on mobile b/c it seems to crash the backend server due to a conflict with heroku hosting.  Contact me if it doesn't work so I can redeploy the server.

Google: https://khiz-google.netlify.app

Local examples and how to:

Youtube: clone repo, enter youtube v2 folder, get your own youtube data api key and place into app.js (info in readme.md of folder) then finally run following commands in order -> npm i, npm build, npm install -g serve, serve -s build

~~Reddit: khiz-reddit.herokuapp.com~~ (needs some backend reconfig because account verification is currently a security risk live, but you can still run it locally).
