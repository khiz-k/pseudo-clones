# Clones w/express or springboot backends
## Hosted and facilatated by netlify, heroku, firebase, aws and SQL/NoSQL databases.

My clones for some of the biggest companies in the world.  Featuring Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Reddit and more...

React (mostly w/Typescript), Redux, Node, Express, NoSQL, HTML, SCSS, Java/Spring
Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, MySQL, Angular, Bootstrap, Flutter

Some live examples:

AirBnb (frontend only): https://airbnb-clone-d6fe5.web.app/

Messenger (v2, still needs styling): https://khiz-chat.netlify.app/ - please don't use it in mobile b/c it seems to crash the backend server.  Contact me if it doesn't work so I can redeploy the server.

~~Google: khiz-google.netlify.app~~ just copy and paste the code and run it live please.

~~Reddit: khiz-reddit.herokuapp.com~~ (database needs reconfiguring because authorization for login is a security risk).
