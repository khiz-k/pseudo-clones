Some live examples:

Youtube: https://khiz-youtube.netlify.app

Spotify: https://khiz-spotify.netlify.app

AirBnb (frontend only): https://airbnb-clone-d6fe5.web.app/

Messenger (v2, still needs styling): https://khiz-chat.netlify.app/ - please don't use it in mobile b/c it seems to crash the backend server.  Contact me if it doesn't work so I can redeploy the server.

Google: https://khiz-google.netlify.app

~~Reddit: khiz-reddit.herokuapp.com~~ (database needs reconfiguring because authorization for login is a security risk).
