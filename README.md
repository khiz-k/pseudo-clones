Some live examples:

Spotify (not mobile friendly yet): https://khiz-spotify.netlify.app

AirBnb (frontend only): https://airbnb-clone-d6fe5.web.app/

Messenger (v2, unique styling): https://khiz-chat.netlify.app/ - please don't use it on mobile b/c it seems to crash the backend server due to a conflict with heroku hosting.  Contact me if it doesn't work so I can redeploy the server.

Google: https://khiz-google.netlify.app

~~Reddit: khiz-reddit.herokuapp.com~~ (needs some backend reconfig because account verification is currently a security risk live, but you can still run it locally).
