# Pseudo Clones (1-2 Day Builds Each)

### My clones for some of the biggest companies in the world, might update them in my free time and work towards completion

#### Hosted and facilatated by netlify, heroku, firebase, mongodb, aws and SQL/NoSQL.

#### Written in React (some w/Typescript), Redux, Node, Express, NoSQL, HTML, SCSS, Java/Spring, Angular, Flutter, etc.

## Some live examples:

MERN TikTok:

MERN Whatsapp:

Firebase & React Facebook(w/google auth & posting ability): https://fb-clone-5930d.web.app/

Firebase & React Netflix (w/movie reel scroll and trailer playability): https://netflix-clone-5966a.web.app/

Firebase & React Twitter: https://twitter-clone-647e1.web.app/ (mongo version can be run locally, just update mongodb details with your own)

Spotify (not mobile friendly yet, plays song trailers): https://khiz-spotify.netlify.app

AirBnb (frontend only): https://airbnb-clone-d6fe5.web.app/

Messenger (v2 w/ unique styling, real-time chat in multiple rooms): Check if server is up: https://khiz-chat-server.herokuapp.com, if it is then go to https://khiz-chat.netlify.app/ to test the app - no mobile b/c it seems to crash the backend server due to a conflict with heroku hosting. Contact me if there's an issue.

Google (search functionality): https://khiz-google.netlify.app

## Local examples and how to:

Youtube (search and play videos): clone repo, enter youtube v2 folder, get your own youtube data api key and place into app.js (info in readme.md of folder) then finally run following commands in order -> npm i, npm build, npm install -g serve, serve -s build

Netflix Mobile (only UI): have flutter and android sdk installed w/an emulator (best is pixel) then get your flutter packages and flutter run.

~~Reddit (login and CRUD): khiz-reddit.herokuapp.com~~ (needs some backend reconfig because account verification is currently a security risk live, but you can still run it locally).
