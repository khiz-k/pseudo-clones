# Clones w/express or springboot backends
## Hosted and facilatated by netlify, heroku, firebase, gcp, aws and SQL and NoSQL databases.

My clones for some of the biggest companies in the world.  Featuring Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Reddit and more...

React (mostly w/Typescript), Redux, Node, Express, NoSQL, HTML, SCSS, Java/Spring
Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, MySQL, Angular, Bootstrap, Flutter

Some live examples:

AirBnb (frontend only): https://airbnb-clone-d6fe5.web.app/

Messenger (v2, still needs styling): https://khiz-chat.netlify.app/ - please don't use it in mobile b/c it seems to crash the backend server.  Contact me if it doesn't work so I can redeploy the server.

~~Reddit: khiz-reddit.herokuapp.com~~ (database needs reconfiguring)
